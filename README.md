# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

A fun Python project built with the `turtle` module where multiple turtles race across the screen.  
Place your bet on a turtle and see if you win — now with a popup result dialog 🎉.

## 📸 Demo
When you run the program:
1. Enter the number of turtles in the race (2–10).
2. Choose your bet (pick a turtle by its number).
3. Watch them race across the screen.
4. Get a popup message box showing if you **won or lost**!

## 🚀 Features
- Random colors assigned to each turtle.
- Randomized movement speeds to make each race unique.
- User can **place bets** before the race starts.
- Clean popup message (using Tkinter) to display results.
- Interactive Turtle graphics window.
