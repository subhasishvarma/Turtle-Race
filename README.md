# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

A fun Python project built with the `turtle` module where multiple turtles race across the screen.  
Place your bet on a turtle and see if you win — now with a popup result dialog 🎉.

---

## 📸 How It Works
1. Enter the number of turtles in the race (between 2 and 10).
2. Choose your bet (pick a turtle number).
3. Watch the colorful turtles race across the screen.
4. Get a popup message box showing if your bet was **successful or not**.

## 🚀 Features
- Random colors for each turtle.  
- Randomized step sizes to make every race different.  
- Place bets interactively using input dialogs.  
- Popup (Tkinter) result notification.  
- Uses only Python’s built-in modules (`turtle`, `random`, `tkinter`).

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- No extra libraries needed.
